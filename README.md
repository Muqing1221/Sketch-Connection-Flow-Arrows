## Motivation
In our day to day activities, we are creating a lot of diagrams in [EPAM](https://www.epam.com). We understood that most of our time we are spending on connecting and drawing arrows for our user flows and to automate that, I created this plugin

## How it works

## Download Plugin
The most recent version you can find here:
[**Download the Latest Arrows Sketch Plugin**](https://github.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-user-flows/releases)
[![Install Sketch Arrows with Sketchpacks](http://sketchpacks-com.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/badges/sketchpacks-badge-install.png "Install Sketch Arrows with Sketchpacks")](https://sketchpacks.com/faridsabitov/Sketch-Connection-Flow-Arrows/install)

## Bonus
This plugin allows you to provide an arrow between two objects, but for creating user flows and sitemaps you need actual objects to interact with. Don't worry, we got your back!
