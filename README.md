## Motivation
In our day to day activities, we are creating a lot of diagrams in [EPAM](http://epam.design). We understood that most of our time we are spending on connecting and drawing arrows for our user flows and to automate that, I created this plugin. You can read full information about the plugin on [Medium](https://medium.com/@faridsabitov)

## How it works
**Create a connection.** Select more than one layer in Sketch and click on "Plugins" 👉 "Connection Arrows" 👉 "Create Connection"

**Update all connections inside artboard.** Select artboard where all the arrows are stored and click on "Plugins" 👉 "Connection Arrows" 👉 "Update Connection" 👉 "From the Selected Artboard"

**Delete connection between two layers.** Select layers that have a connection and click on "Plugins" 👉 "Connection Arrows" 👉 "Delete Connection" 👉 "Between Selected"

**Arrow Direction.** By the default you will have an "Auto" mode, that will draw arrows based on the position of the second layer but if you are creating userflows or sitemap, where all the arrows are pointed in one direction, you can specify it in settings

**Arrow Spacing.** For saving time and not moving all the layers one by one, you can pre-define spacing in settings. When you will create or update connection between two objects, it will automatically move the second layer for a specified amount of pixels ✌️

**Auto-align.** If your second object is misaligned for less than 5px with this option turned on the plugin will auto-align the second object based on the direction. So you don't need to spend time aligning everything 🤘

## Bonus
This plugin allows you to provide an arrow between two objects, but for creating user flows and sitemaps you need actual objects to interact with. Don't worry, we got your back!
